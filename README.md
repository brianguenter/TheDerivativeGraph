# The Derivative Graph and its use

The derivative graph is a data structure that represents the derivative of a function as a graph. It is both a means of implementing efficient automatic differentiation (AD) algorithms and a more perspicuous way of analyzing and understanding these algorithms. The derivative graph is a powerful new tool which gives the developer great flexibility when designing new general purpose AD systems.
